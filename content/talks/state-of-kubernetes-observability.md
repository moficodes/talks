## Pitch

Kubernetes is a complex system with many moving parts. Observability is supposed to give you the insights you need to make this easier. But one quick visit to the CNCF landscape can overwhelm you with the sheer number of tools that exist in the observability space. This talk we will try to distill observability to its core parts and give you the cliffnotes on what you need to know to “know” your Kubernetes workload.
Abstract

## Description

Kubernetes has redefined how we think about deploying and managing distributed applications. But it can be difficult to understand how all these complex parts work together. Debugging and troubleshooting can be challenging, especially in a production environment. When something goes wrong, it can be hard to know where to start looking for the problem. Thats where Kubernetes observability comes in. With the right tools and practices, you can gain deep insights into how your applications are running on Kubernetes.
Observability is the cornerstone of any well-functioning Kubernetes environment. But one visit to the CNCF landscape can cause your eyes to glaze over with all of the options that exist in this space. It can be quite overwhelming to make sense of it all. In this talk, I will walk through some of the more common observability tools and frameworks that are available for Kubernetes today. I will also discuss how you can use them to troubleshoot your applications in production and debug issues in development.
